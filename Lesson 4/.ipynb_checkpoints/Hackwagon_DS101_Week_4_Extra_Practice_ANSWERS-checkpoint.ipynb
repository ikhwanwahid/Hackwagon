    "    \n",
    "    (Question 6) \n",
    "      Answer: 3\n",
    "      By creating a variable with the first element of the list. \n",
    "      We can safely assume the first element is the highest number.\n",
    "      We then iterate through the list to find out if any number is higher than the current x variable\n",
    "      Afterwards then replace the current value with current x variable. \n",
    "      This will we will be able to find the highest value among the list\n",
    "      \n",
    "    (Question 7) \n",
    "      Answer: 2\n",
    "      By creating a variable at the start that contains 0. It is our counter variable.\n",
    "      We then iterate through the list to find out if any numbers are higher than 4\n",
    "      If there are numbers higher than 4 we add into x\n",
    "     \n",
    "    (Question 8) \n",
    "      Answer: 1\n",
    "      By creating 2 variables with 0 values.\n",
    "      We can treat one of the them as the total value (in this case, y)\n",
    "      And the other as the count value (in this case, z)\n",
    "      As average is calculated by total / count\n",
    "      We then iterate through the list to find numbers that are even\n",
    "      Lastly, we calculate average OUTSIDE of the for loop\n",
    "      \n",
    "    (Question 9)\n",
    "      Answer: 2\n",
    "      By creating a variable that has 0 at the start. This is our counter variable.\n",
    "      We then iterate through the list to find numbers that equates to 1\n",
    "      Notice that '1' is not the same as 1. Data types are important when it comes to ==\n",
    "      If it is true, we += 1 to the count variable. (in this case, y)\n",
    "      \n",
    "    (Question 10) \n",
    "      Answer: 3\n",
    "      This is a typical counting with dictionary question\n",
    "      \n",
    "    (Question 11)\n",
    "      Answer: 4\n",
    "      This is a typical counting with dictionary question\n",
    "      Notice that dictionary can accept number as their key too.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    (Question 12) \n",
    "      Answer: 1\n",
    "      This is a typical mistake made by students when it comes to counting with dictionary.\n",
    "      By hard-coding the key, it is making the mistake of not counting each element in the dictionary\n",
    "      But just counting the number hard-coding key. Which is not what you want.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    (Question 13) \n",
    "      Answer: 2\n",
    "      This is a typical mistake made by students when it comes to counting with dictionary.\n",
    "      lines after if else conditions has to be indented\n",
    "      \n",
    "    (Question 14) \n",
    "      Answer: 3\n",
    "      This is a typical mistake made by students when it comes to counting with dictionary.\n",
    "      The if condition on line 4 should place the same variable that you are using as key\n",
    "      on line 5 and 7. This way you will ensure that you are checking the correct key in \n",
    "      dictionary, placing the correct key in dictionary and \n",
    "       \n",
    "    (Question 15) \n",
    "      Answer: 4\n",
    "      Need to be extra careful on checking whether the variable is within the newly created\n",
    "      dictionary rather than the list that is iterating through."

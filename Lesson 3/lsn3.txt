With loops:

    for i in range(10):
        print("Hello World!")


seq = {
    "num_1": 10,
    "num_2": 20,
    "num_3": 30,
} 

# Write code below
# for key, value in dictionary.items():  REMEMBER THIS!
for key, value in seq.items():
    print("key is", key, ", value is", value)


CIETU FRAMEWORK
Create the results container
Iterate the input data/list
Extract the necessary data
Test conditions of each value
Update the results container when condition is fulfilled

Operations
%	a % b	Modulo	Remainder when a is divided by b
//	a // b	Floor Division (also called Integer Division)	Quotient when a is divided by b, rounded to the next smallest whole number
**	a ** b	Exponentiation	a raised to the power of b
